# NASAConnect
Connection library for NASA Android apps.

## Introduction

*This is my first attempt at creating a github-hosted library, so please work with me here. Things are going to be broken for quite some time.*

The NASA Controller is an Android app that serves as the conduit between the NASA Contributors and the Google Firebase Database. It speaks Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the Contributors, and uses the Firebase API calls to put Contributor records directly into the database.
